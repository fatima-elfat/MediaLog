# MediaLog
## A Personal Media Consumption Tracker

---
# Project Title & Description
** MediaLog ** is a personal media consumption tracker. It is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage and organize their media consumption habits. The app provides a single, centralized platform for logging progress on TV shows, movies, books, and podcasts.

** Who it's for **: This tool is for anyone who enjoys media but struggles to keep track of their watching, reading, or listening journey across various platforms.

** Why it matters **: In today's fragmented digital world, it is easy to lose track of what episode you were on or what book you wanted to read next. This project aims to solve this problem by offering a dedicated space for users to track their progress, create schedules, and eventually share their experiences with friends.

# AI Integration Strategy
I will use AI tools at every stage of the development process to enhance productivity, ensure code quality, and maintain comprehensive documentation. I'll use it for *Code Generation* of core components and features of the application. Also use it in the *Testing* to write comprehensive test suites, which is crucial for building a reliable application. For the *Documentation* AI will be my co-pilot for documentation, ensuring the project remains easy to understand and maintain.
Finally, after each major feature, I will use an AI tool to automatically generate an updated *README.md* file.
