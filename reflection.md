# Reflection on Capstone Development
We're living in an era of transformation. AI is flourishing, and despite its current imperfections, its continued development is inevitable. One undeniable truth is that AI is reshaping our daily lives, especially for professionals like software developers.
AI has the potential to redefine learning and productivity by acting as a co-pilot. It can automate repetitive tasks, freeing users to focus on creativity, higher-order thinking, and problem-solving. The key is to design systems that prioritize collaboration, ensuring AI support. While AI can generate code or analyze data, it lacks the nuanced judgment, contextual understanding, and ethical reasoning that humans possess. I can confirm this is true. My journey while creating the project MediLog with Cursor and CodeRabbit proved that these tools could be essential.
Cursor, especially the agent mode, is seriously powerful. Instead of manually writing code or complex functions, I could simply tell Cursor what I wanted in plain English. For example, when building the authentication system for MediaLog, I used Cursor to generate the initial Express.js routes for user registration and login. Instead of typing out each line, you just need to meticulously craft the command, like: "Create an Express route for user registration that hashes the password with bcrypt and saves the user to a MongoDB database."
Once I had a feature ready, it was time for a pull request. This is where CodeRabbit came in. CodeRabbit would analyze my code, point out potential bugs, suggest improvements, and even identify security risks. For instance, it flagged an error in my Prisma schema. It's like having a senior developer reviewing my code, giving me feedback to improve the quality of my work.
In essence, AI tools like Cursor and CodeRabbit aren't replacements for human developers but powerful force to help. They handle the mundane and repetitive aspects of coding, allowing developers to allocate their time and mental energy to more complex and creative challenges. By embracing this collaborative model, professionals can not only enhance their productivity but also elevate the overall quality and security of their work.
